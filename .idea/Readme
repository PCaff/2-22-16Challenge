This project is coded for fun. It's a simple Reddit Challenge of the Day:

When you were a little kid, was indiscriminately flicking light switches super fun? I know it was for me.
Let's tap into that and try to recall that feeling with today's challenge.
Imagine a row of N light switches, each attached to a light bulb. All the bulbs are off to start with.
You are going to release your inner child so they can run back and forth along this row of light switches,
flipping bunches of switches from on to off or vice versa.
The challenge will be to figure out the state of the lights after this fun happens.
